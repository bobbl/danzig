# There is an environment variable SOC_ROOT to support out-of-tree SoC
# definitions, but it does not work (as of zephyr 2.2.0-rc3).
# Therefore use an existing SoC definition for another RISC-V platform.
# SOC_RISCV32_MIV 
#
# Additionally, an existing UART driver must be chosen and only drivers that
# match the SoC definition are allowed.
# The driver won't be used, but it is necessary to choose one, otherwise no
# file from zephyr/drivers/serial/ will be linked and this gives a build
# error if CONFIG_SERIAL_HAS_DRIVER is set.
#
# SOC_RISCV32_MIV is chosen because it has a very small UART driver without a
# PLIC.
